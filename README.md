# gvs

go/global/general versioning system

  > ask user details if missing (no more git config or bazaar whoami)

  > warn about damaged data (SHA-3 hashing), missing files or wrong permissions
* **strict RBAC** (requires all access through roles, and permissions are connected only to roles, not directly to users.)
* **repository pointers** aka nested repositories
* integrated **tickets** and **wiki/docs**
* integrated SSL server to host repository
  > autogenerated self-signed cert
* tracking of **large binary data**
* **tracking of directories**
* **tracking of folder and file permissions**

what is different from GIT:

* integrated SSL server.. should be as easy as 
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer
* integrated RBAC
* send the patches by email (darcs send)

## Issues with other vcs

* Poor handling of binary data
* Submodules are very difficult to work with effectively, and are limited to including an entire
* Steep learning curve
* no diffs on binary files
* The repository is a bunch of files that can easily be ruined by some accident.
* Inconsistent command line interface
* Revert features with ease
